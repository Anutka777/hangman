# Hangman


A **Hangman game** on the command line.

There is a random word you want to guess.\
Enter a single letter. If you get this one right, it will appear on the game board in certain place. If not - you just lost a try.\
Guess word in 12 tries and you're the winner!

You can find more details on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game))

I also implemented a simple save-game functionality, so you may type **save** and your progress would be reliably secure until you type this **save** word again ;)\
Cause there should only be one save *(I p-p-promise it's a feature and not my laziness ^_^)*.\
At the start of a game you'll have an option to load that save state of yours or try to guess a new word.

You may run this game on [repl.it](https://replit.com/@Anutka777/hangman#.replit). Just hit a big green Run button. Hope you'll enjoy!
